# RoomHub Component Reference Files

This folder contains reference JSX files that were used as a starting point for creating the actual TypeScript components in the RoomHub application.

## Contents

- `DashboardCard.jsx` - Card component used on the Dashboard
- `EventForm.jsx` - Form for creating and editing calendar events
- `Footer.jsx` - Application footer component
- `GuestForm.jsx` - Form for adding and editing guests
- `GuestProfileCard.jsx` - Card for displaying guest information
- `Navbar.jsx` - Application navigation bar

## Note

These files are reference implementations and are not used directly in the application. The actual components have been implemented in TypeScript and integrated into the appropriate locations in the `client/src/components` directory.
